A little how-to on building critters:
Take a look at main.py. You should create a critter class
(e.g. hummingloop.py or boxworm.py) that has a get_frames()
method that simply returns the relevant frames. Take a look at
those two files' respective dependencies for a template.

Then, running main.py (with simple modifications) should generate 
wav files in a wav/ folder (gitignored) for incorporation into the
unity project.
